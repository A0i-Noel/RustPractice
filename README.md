# Overview Project name :Rust Practice

In this project, I will learn basic knowledge in Rust. Also, since this language is totally new for me and not even similar to other languages which I learned before, I will focus on how to create learning curve.

This is the programmings which I made
1. Try to understand the advantage of using rust
2. Establish the effective way to learn new language
3. keep coding to learn
